          <p class="para">I began working on social media, primarily Instagram, in the fall of 2017. My good friend and
            I were growing sports pages for fun, when he received a message from a company called Bullpen Labs. Bullpen
            (now Wave Sports) wanted to buy his basketball page of approximately thirty thousand followers and pay him
            monthly to manage it. This was an unthinkable opportunity for us at the time, and it made clear to me that social media
            was a real business.<br>‍<br>I was very intrigued and immediately found a page of my own, sold it to Wave,
            and joined their team. At the time, I didn’t even have a personal Instagram page because I saw no value in
            social media, but this changed my entire mindset towards the medium.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left Wave to found my
            own venture, Cuick, I was managing @dunked (now @buckets) with over eight hundred thousand followers at the
            time and a team of five content creators that I directed.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>I have done social media advertising
            campaigns for companies such as Playline and more recently, TikTok. A personal page that I am currently growing is @gadgetings.<br></p>
