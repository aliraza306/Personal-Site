  <p>Foam - Social Data is an iOS and Android App created by Perry Zhang ‘24 and Charlie Ambrose ‘25. 
    Our goal with Foam is to give boards, assemblies, and other governing bodies a more productive way to communicate with and listen to the people they govern. 
    The current methods of communication between the Student Assembly and Dartmouth students is clunky, outdated, and ill-equipped to handle the level of discussion needed to facilitate a healthy environment on campus and beyond. Regular data is generated in a top-down fashion (The governing body requests responses to a concern). 
    At Foam, we are democratizing visual data by giving people the ability to easily share their own concerns, thoughts, and suggestions, giving the governing bodies easy access to the true ideas for change.<p>
