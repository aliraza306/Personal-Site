          <H2>The Machine of Man - Thoughts on Orwell's <i>1984</i><font size = "4"<p> 2/10/21</p><H2>
<body>
			<p><font size = "3.5"><p>Man and machine can only coexist for so long. The totalitarian state of George Orwell’s <i>1984</i> seeks to replace man with machine. This destruction of humanity is not far from that of the Nazis or the Soviets, but the Party of Oceania goes even a step further by seeking power solely for power; this proves to be the true evil of <i>1984</i>.<p> 
	<p>During his interrogation of Winston Smith, O’Brien reveals that he and the rest of the Party care about nothing other than power. They see power “as an end, not as a means to an end.” Power for the Party is not a way to gain praise, money, or territory; it is simply power, itself, which they torture and kill for. This totalitarian state seeks to make man as close to machine as possible, while still leaving a sliver of humanity inside each person’s battered shell because power, as O’Brien explains, is the ability to inflict unlimited pain on another person. All O’Brien seeks in life is the ability to inflict unlimited pain on another person forever. Instead of attempting to make the world like Heaven, he has chosen to make the world Hell, and he is Satan.<p>
	<p>In the society of <i>1984</i>, there is no crime; nothing is inherently morally wrong (because there are no morals), but everything is punishable. This is awfully similar to many of the cries from our society today, demanding that there is no right or wrong. Too many people want to be held responsible for nothing, but are quick to crush anyone who may think the “wrong” thought. It is doublethink at its finest, and it is tearing society to shreds. Once there is no level, moral ground that everyone stands on, society will fall and fall until it crashes and burns like that of <i>1984</i>.<p>
	<p>Orwell’s <i>1984</i> is a chilling premonition of what is to come if morals are abandoned and power is handed over to the totalitarian government creeping up right here. True morality must come back to the front of society if Americans wish to remain humans and not be welded into a governed machine.<p><p> - Charlie</p>
