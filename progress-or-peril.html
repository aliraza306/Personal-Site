<H2>Progress or Peril?<H2>
  <p>“What do we want to want?” Dr. Harari poses this question to close Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. The question encapsulates the human experience over the past 70,000 years. Not only, “What do we want?” but, “What do we want to want?” Safety? Progress? Riches? The reign of Homo Sapiens has been incredibly fruitful for our species, but will our insatiable drive for more extinguish our race entirely? Living life solely to gain more seems to be a futile choice. For tens of thousands of years, progressing as a species has been our goal, but will this ever sought after progress take us to Heaven or Hell?<p>
	<p>Most people would agree that one of their top ambitions in life is to achieve true happiness. The universal blueprint for happiness remains a mystery, but Dr. Harari poses the idea that all our progress might not be a contributing factor to this societal goal; in fact, it could be inhibiting us. He discusses the possible downfall of the Agricultural Revolution that is almost universally seen as a needed and great turning point for mankind.<p>
<p>This settling of nomadic sapiens to become farmers occurred somewhere between 8,000 and 2,000 B.C. That is over 60,000 years into mankind’s existence. We are hunter-gatherers by nature and not meant to be sedentary. If happiness is the goal, did this transition from our roots impede us? Tribes of humans freely roamed plains and jungles with small familial bands for 60,000 years, living invigorating lives of hunting massive animals and exploring new domains. Most of that lifestyle is now obsolete and has been replaced with dreary commutes and hours on end in a chair, staring at metal and glass. Was this a fruitful change?<p> 
<p>Human progress is something we continue to strive for. Grow larger, run faster, live longer: these characteristics are the inevitable objectives. Yuval Harari’s Sapiens brings to light a different idea of what it means to be human and questions whether all the scientific and technological progress we are striving for is truly good. To achieve true success as a species, humans must answer the question, “What do we want to want?”<p>
