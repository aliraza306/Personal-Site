<H2>Hey<H2>
  <p>We would use the prize money to increase our server capacity to make Foam run smoothly with the amount of users we plan to attract, as well make it so our bandwidth will be able to handle more traffic. We also have many features that we would like to add (some of these features will be bonus for a price tier structure). Perry and I also plan on putting some of the prize money towards our initial marketing campaigns. However, we do not plan on wasting the prize money on Facebook or Instagram ads. <p>
